## Implementation

RMS has been developed following the REST principles; the following table shows which HTTP methods have been used for each servlet.

|  HTTP methods  | GET | POST | PUT | DELETE |
|--------------|:----:|:---:|:---:|:------:|
| device | x | | x | x |
| user | x | | | x |
| devices | x | | | x |
| users | x | | | |
| encryptionKey | x | | | |

## Requirements
These are the base requirements to build and use Richkware:

-   Java 1.8 or higher
-   MySQL

## Get Started

Open the configuration file (/src/main/resources/configuration.properties) and set the parameters inside it. In particular:

- __database.url__: address of the database, RMS supports MySQL, if you want to use another one, it may not work. (default: jdbc:mysql://db:3306/)
- __database.username__: username used to access to the database (default: root)
- __database.password__: password used to access to the database (default: richk)
- __encryptionkey__: encryption key used to exchange message to Richkware and RMC. if you change this parameter, remember to change also the configurations in Richkware and RMC (default: richktest)

now we can build the "war" file, executing the following command:
    
    mvn package

then you can deploy RMS using __docker-compose__

    docker-compose up

finally, you can open [RMS](http://0.0.0.0:8080/Richkware-Manager-Server/).
